## Introduction

This workshop will walk you through the process of moving an existing application into a CI/CD pipeline and deploying it to a WebLogic cluster and a ACCS Node.js instance in the Oracle Public Cloud.

You will take on 2 personas during the workshop. The **Lead Developer Persona** will be responsible for configuring the parts of the automated build and deploy process that involve details about the application itself. The **DevOps Engineer Persona** will configure the parts of the automation involving the JCS and ACCS infrastructure. To automate the building and deploying of this application you will make use of Developer Cloud Service for CI/CD, JCS for hosting JET UI frontend, and ACCS for hosting the Rewards Service.

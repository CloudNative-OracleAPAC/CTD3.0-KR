In the previous lab we have created a Custom Property **‘userXX_DocumentApproval’** and assigned it to a folder **‘xx_Document Workflow’**.

### 4.1. Now we will create the necessary sub-folders for our document workflow sample. ### 

1.	Tick the checkbox beside your **xx_Document Workflow** folder. 

2.	Select ``Share`` from the upper menu

3.	Share your folder with **Bala.Gupta** and give this user ``contributor`` rights

4.	Inside the **‘xx_Document Workflow’** folder, create a subfolder **‘Inbox’**.

5.	Create another subfolder **‘Approved’** on the same level.

6.	We are now using this folder to assign a document workflow process from Process Cloud to it.

7.	Select the **Inbox** folder. 

8.	Select the **Properties** link.

9.	Set the toggle field to **“Initiate Process on Document Arrival”**

10.	Select the Process Name ``xx_Production:Document_Workflow_-_from_Chris 1.0.`` This is how you are linking your folder to the process you want to trigger upon arrival of a document.

11.	Select **Save**. Reopen the properties to make sure that your settings have been taken into account. It should look like this:

12.	Next, verify that Metadata has been enabled for your DOCS environment, and what metadata collection has been set on your **‘xx_Document Workflow’** folder. 

13.	Return to your **xx_Document_Workflow** folder and enable the metadata for it: 

a.	Set the view on Customer Properties

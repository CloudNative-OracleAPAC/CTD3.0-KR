# QuickStart for Content and Experience Cloud
## CECS QUICK START KIT – AN OVERVIEW
**Oracle Autonomous Content and Experience Cloud** is a cloud-based content hub to drive omni-channel content management and accelerate experience delivery. The mentioned Autonomous Content & Experience Cloud Service (CECS) project contains the provisioning video and lab material to demonstrate the detailed steps for facilitating the adoption exercise for the customers. Basis this guide, the relevant stakeholders can provision an Autonomous CECS environment and plan for usage as per each customer’s specific requirements. These assets are part of the APAC Cloud TEST Drive 3.0 workshop content. 

## OBJECTIVE OF THE CECS QUICK START KIT

The key objective of the CECS Quick Start Kit is to enable our cloud customers on an important area of content collaboration and web experience. The assets will help in the following:

**Self-service tools:** Help the customers understand what tools are available around CECS adoption at a single place, and be empowered to drive usage of the CECS at their own respective pace. 

**Proactively Identify Business Case for CECS:** Help the customer stakeholders including IT and business teams to identify and showcase simple use cases of CECS like building a content-centric static site to engage with business teams. There are areas where customers are evaluating content collaboration, microsite and website creation solutions and CECS becomes a powerful offering to help them address the mentioned three areas.

The above simple videos will give confidence to customers to understand the ease of the solution and share scenarios with internal stakeholders, implementation partners and other Oracle experts to undertake quick adoption.

## OUTCOME OF THE CECS QUICK START KIT
With the CECS assets available at a single place and designed with the sole objective of helping Oracle customers adopt the innovative offerings, the desired outcome of this exercise would be to have the Oracle Universal Credit customers have a provisioned instance of Autonomous CECS and successfully adopt some of the low hanging use cases of CECS like building a static microsite and building on a content hub.

Name: The Perfect Coffee
Description: What makes the perfect coffee
Author: Jamie Oliver
Category: DRINKS

Content:
Perfect coffee pleasure, is no accident: it must be deliberately created,
consistently and without compromise, cup after cup, by living our
principles.

Along the complex path from bean to cup there are quicker ways of doing
things than we do, and there are certainly cheaper ways. But there is no
better way. Knowing a single faulty bean can taint a whole batch, we take
control of quality down to the very last one â€“ with a deliberate dedication
to getting the details right at every step of the way.

> Note eg. https://`username%40oracle.com@`developer.us2.oraclecloud.com/developer-gse00000000`/s/developer-gse0000000_mytravel_27505/scm/mytravel.git` reduce to
`https://developer.us2.oraclecloud.com/developer-gse00000000/`

Click **`Save Credentials`**. 

![](../resources/images/devcs/devcs14.png)
